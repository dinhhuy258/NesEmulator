# NesEmulator
I wrote this emulator just for studying

##Building
- cd [emulator-root]
- cd src
- make

##Using 
- After building the source code type "make run" on terminal to run emulator

##Controls
| NES           | Key           |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| Up            | W             |
| Down          | S             |
| Left          | A             |
| Right         | D             |
| A             | L             |
| B             | K             |
| Select        | Space         |
| Start         | Enter         |

##Mappers
- NROM (0)

##Issues
- Haven't implemented APU
- There are some issues with renderring but I think it's ok and I will fix it later
- Few mapper are supported

Thanks to the [NES community](http://nesdev.com/) for helping me complete this project
